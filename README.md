# Northwestern Coding Bootcamp Project 2: LocalSpot

## Description

When visitors come to Chicago they're always told to go to the same places; go for a walk at Navy Pier or hit up the Museum Campus then grab yourself a slice of pizza at Giordanos or a hot dog at Portillos… Which is totally fine, but what about the local spots? With LocalSpot we're presenting users both new to and familiar with Chicago a curated list of spots that the locals like to go to. 

Check out LocalSpot at https://agile-journey-25400.herokuapp.com/ and drop a like on the LocalSpots you love or would love to check out! You might even find a totally new LocalSpot to hit up!
